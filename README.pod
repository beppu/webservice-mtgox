=head1 WebService::MtGox - a Perl interface to MtGox's BitCoin trading API

=head2 What is BitCoin?

Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer currency. Peer-to-peer means that no central
authority issues new money or tracks transactions. These tasks are managed
collectively by the network.  I have a feeling that this might be a real
game changer, and it will be very interesting to see how governments and
banks react to this new liberatory technology.

=head2 What is MtGox?

L<MtGox|https://mtgox.com/> is currently (as of June 2011) the most heavily
traded BitCoin market.  They have been kind enough to provide an API that
lets you automate your trading.

=head2 Some Sample Code

Using L<MtGox's Trading API|https://mtgox.com/support/tradeAPI> via Perl.

  use common::sense;
  use WebService::MtGox;

  my $m = WebService::MtGox->new(user => 'me', password => 's3cr3t');
  my $depth = $m->depth;
  my $buy   = $m->buy(amount => 10, price => 30.9999);
  my $sell  = $m->sell(amount => 10, price => 34.54321);
